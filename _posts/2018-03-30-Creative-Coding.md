## Creative Coding for Kids


#### Scope :

Led brand strategy; authored content and tracked interaction with web analytics tools. Provided client with website enhancement proposals to address user-experience and SEO. Components included: curriculum content, brand positioning recommendations, as well as email marketing and lead cultivation.

- Guided 84 elementary students through 30 weeks of UX design principles and coding coursework
- Coordinated with 30 teachers to develop an online learning solution that addressed the students' learning challenges and coding accessibility

#### Asking Questions 
We were trying to solve a few problems within our parent communities. The first is that customers were asking duplicate questions when they could be getting an answer immediately. We also noticed that a lot of questions werenâ€™t being formatted correctly, and adequate details were not being added.

#### Favorite part: 

Other than creating a strategy around kids? Managing the company outreach & cponsorship is a blast because you get to watch the team build new relationship and the brand interaction locally.
