# Asking Questions <a name="quest"></a>
We were trying to solve a few problems within our parent communities. The first is that customers were asking duplicate questions when they could be getting an answer immediately. We also noticed that a lot of questions werenâ€™t being formatted correctly, and adequate details were not being added.

# Favorite part: 

Other than creating a strategy around kids? Managing the company outreach & cponsorship is a blast because you get to watch the team build new relationship and the brand interaction locally.
