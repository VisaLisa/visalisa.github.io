#### Asking Questions 

I loved watching my team build new relationship and the brand interaction with local communities and businesses. We were always trying to solve problems by asking questions to how we can improve. Within our parent community, we notice there was a heighten concern with kids safety. To address this, we made "Be safe" rules within our course. Showing examples of how to be safe in a classroom, from physical safety to internet dangers, help our students and parents
