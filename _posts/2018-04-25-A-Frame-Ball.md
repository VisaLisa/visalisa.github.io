## Learning A-Frame for VR

## Content
1. [Introduction](#intro) 
2. [My Code](#code)
3. [The Experience](#experience)

### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
A-Frame was developed by Mozilla in 2016. It makes VR easily to access by website. No need for full headmount displays, a Google cardboard for your phone or even a desktop can help you begin your VR experience.

### My Code <a name="code"></a>
I put my code for the Ball & Plane experience on my github for people to learn and understand the A-frame structure. [Check it out!](https://github.com/VisaLisa/VR-Aframe)

### The Experience <a name="experience"></a>
Check out [Ball & Plane](https://visalisa.github.io/VR-Aframe/). The experience is still in developments and I will be working on adding more features. Please feel free to provide feedback on how I can improve.
