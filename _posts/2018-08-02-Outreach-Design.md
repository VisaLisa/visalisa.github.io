### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

### UX Design <a name="UX"></a>

Getting Started Page
<img src="/img/portfolio/Outreach/Getting-started.png" width="718px">

I would want to adjust the amount of space there is in the getting started and have the font be more aligned.

"Register|Free" goes to a Login Page; not a registration page

Login Page
<img src="/img/portfolio/Outreach/Login-screen.png" width="718px">

Within the Login Screen, one thing I would add is a registration button.

It does not provide any way for the sign up process. 

### Long-Term Goal <a name="long-term"></a>
My long term goal for Outreach is to add a certification for the platform.

The certification would add value by:

1. Creating customer engagement to learn the Outreach platform
2. Employers/supervisiors being training on the tools and see milestones
3. Certification can be put on your resume
