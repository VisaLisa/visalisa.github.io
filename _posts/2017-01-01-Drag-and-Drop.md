# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
This is my team's 2017 Microsoft VR/AR Hackathon submission. A Google DayDream app that enables pasting capabilities while in a 360-photo space. I designed the UX workflow and helped our developer write the CSS for this project.

My first VR Hackathon! Worked on a team of 3 and took part as the UX Designer on the team. We won 1st place!
