#### Intro <a name="intro"></a>
From when we were born to now, we all have relied on senses to simply live in the world. Senses, such as taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing are the five senses we most often use to build our experince of this reality. Everything that we know about our perception comes by the way of our sense. 

Virtual reality (VR) takes what we know in our world and transport us to the digital world. In the digtial world, developers and designers are creating everything from game experiences to healthcare training, which will one day be seen every where.


#### What is VR/AR? <a name="what"></a>
(`Virtual Reality`) is simulating an digital environment through the use of computer technology. Until you actually get into a headset, the textbook meaning of virtual reality might be the most dry sentence you might ever hear. Virtual reality is becoming a growing industry because of it's limitless ability to create almost anything. It has added a new medium for people to explore their senses, such as vision, hearing, touch, and even, smell. 

(`Augmented Reality`) is superimposing 3D graphics over the user's view of the real world. Augmented reality uses more sensors to determine the hardware's position and orientation of the camera.
