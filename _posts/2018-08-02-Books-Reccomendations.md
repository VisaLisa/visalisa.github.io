#### Intro <a name="intro"></a>

I wanted to learn as much as possible about building great teams and professional growth quickly. To reach this goal, I challenged myself to read 3 books a week for a year. The math coming out to 106 books. How I got there was making time in my day to read and audiobook. These methods increased the time I spend reading a book by x3.

- 30 minutes of reading a day
- Audiobook everywhere (in traffic, at work, even while cooking)
- Library trip once a week - see what resources they have
- OverDrive - they're a great resource for free books and audiobook

#### Lisa's Book Recommendation

I made of list of highly recommended reading selection that I made over the years. The books range in a variety of genres from business to cooking. I added links to purchase the book on Amazon (not sponsored), but I would highly encourage checking if your local library has any of them.
