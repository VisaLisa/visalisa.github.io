#### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
In the past hour, I learn how to quickly make a AR app using Facebook's AR Studio Player. With most of the VR/AR market focused on headsets or content, Facebook segmented their selves (excluding Oculus) into the AR marketing by introducing more AR content. Facebook has made developing AR easy with their Studio Player.

#### Getting Started <a name="started"></a>
Let's get started by downloading the following tools: 
##### Tools
- [AR Studio](https://developers.facebook.com/products/ar-studio) on Mac (Mines is a Macbook Air)
- [AR Player](https://itunes.apple.com/app/facebook/id1231451896) on iPhone (I'm using my iPhone 7)
- USB to Lightinging cable (This will be used to sync your new app)

# Resources <a name="resources"></a>
